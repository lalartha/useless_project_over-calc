### Project Description
[our project is an overly complicated calculator.It is a device overloaded with excessive functions, settings, and displays, often requiring a manual just to complete basic tasks. Despite its high-tech design, it tends to hinder rather than help, making simple calculations feel like advanced engineering]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[we are solving the simple maths calculation by making it a more humerous and time consuming way just for entertainment]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[we are asking to solve a basic arthematic operation inorder to enter a number that the user need to be calculated]
